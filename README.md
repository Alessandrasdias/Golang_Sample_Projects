Project trials 

1 - Party Invites:
------------------------------
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Yearâ€™s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these key features: A home page that shows information about the party A form that can be used to RSVP, which will display a thank-you page Validation to ensure the RSVP form is filled out A summary page that shows who is coming to the party


2 - Graphs
---------------------------------
An exercise on Graphs using GO
Implementation of add Vertex and add Edge using the adjacency list, and slice for the list instead of the liked list in order to be more efficient, and to use a basic data structure provided by Golang.  


3 - Two Sum 
---------------------------------

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
