!! Comments are related to way I tried to solve the problems in my head first, there could be more than one answer, so I picked one and used to code

-----------------------------

!! The activities done are from: 

-> Leet Code
-> Youtube videos

Project trials 

1 - Party Invites:
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Party_invites
------------------------------
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Year’s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these key features: A home page that shows information about the party A form that can be used to RSVP, which will display a thank-you page Validation to ensure the RSVP form is filled out A summary page that shows who is coming to the party


2 - Graphs
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Graphs
---------------------------------
An exercise on Graphs using GO
Implementation of add Vertex and add Edge using the adjacency list, and slice for the list instead of the liked list in order to be more efficient, and to use a basic data structure provided by Golang.  


3 - Two Sum 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/two_sum
---------------------------------

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.


4 - First Letter 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/firstLetter
---------------------------------

First Letter to Appear Twice
Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

5 - Maximum Subarray
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/maximum_subarray
---------------------------------

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum.

6 - Move Zeroes
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/move_zeroes
---------------------------------
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

7 - Contains Duplicate
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/contains_duplicate
---------------------------------
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
