https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Graphs
---------------------------------
An exercise on Graphs using GO
Implementation of add Vertex and add Edge using the adjacency list, and slice for the list instead of the liked list in order to be more efficient, and to use a basic data structure provided by Golang.  


3 - Two Sum 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/two_sum
---------------------------------

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.


4 - First Letter 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/firstLetter
