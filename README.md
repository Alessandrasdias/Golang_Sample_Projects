Project trials 

1 - Party Invites:
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Party_invites
------------------------------
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Year’s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these key features: A home page that shows information about the party A form that can be used to RSVP, which will display a thank-you page Validation to ensure the RSVP form is filled out A summary page that shows who is coming to the party


2 - Graphs
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Graphs
---------------------------------
An exercise on Graphs using GO
Implementation of add Vertex and add Edge using the adjacency list, and slice for the list using a basic data structure provided by Golang.  


3 - Two Sum 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/two_sum
---------------------------------

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.


4 - First Letter 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/firstLetter
---------------------------------

First Letter to Appear Twice
Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

5 - Maximum Subarray
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/maximum_subarray
---------------------------------

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum.

6 - Move Zeroes
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/move_zeroes
---------------------------------
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

7 - Contains Duplicate
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/contains_duplicate
---------------------------------
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.


8 -  Rotate Array
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/rotate
---------------------------------
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

9 -  Remove K From Linked List
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/remove-linked-list
---------------------------------
Given a singly linked list of integers l and an integer k, remove all elements from list l that have a value equal to k.

10 - Rotate image
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/rotate_image
---------------------------------
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

11 - Find substrings
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/findSubstrings
---------------------------------
You have two arrays of strings, words and parts. Return an array that contains the strings from words, modified so that any occurrences of the substrings from parts are surrounded by square brackets []

12 - Sudoku grid validation
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/sudoku
---------------------------------
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with numbers in such a way that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid all contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 one time.

13 - Plus Minus 
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/plusMinus
---------------------------------
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

14 - Min Max sum  
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/minMax
---------------------------------

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

15 - Time Conversion
https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/time_conversion
---------------------------------

Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
