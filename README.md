Project trials 

1 - Party Invites:
------------------------------
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Yearâ€™s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these key features: A home page that shows information about the party A form that can be used to RSVP, which will display a thank-you page Validation to ensure the RSVP form is filled out A summary page that shows who is coming to the party


2 - Graphs
---------------------------------
An exercise on Graphs using GO
Implementation of add Vertex and add Edge using the adjacency list, and slice for the list instead of the liked list in order to be more efficient, and to use a basic data structure provided by Golang.  


3 - Two Sum 
---------------------------------

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

4 - First Letter 
---------------------------------

First Letter to Appear Twice

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

Note:

A letter a appears twice before another letter b if the second occurrence of a is before the second occurrence of b.
s will contain at least one letter that appears twice.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccbaacz"
Output: "c"
Explanation:
The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5 and 6.
The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3 and 7.
The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice, because out of all the letters the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
