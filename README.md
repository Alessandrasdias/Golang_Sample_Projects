|1|[Party Invites](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Party_invites)| Freeman, Adam. Pro Go. Apress. Kindle Edition.
|2|[Graphs](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/Graphs)| An exercise on Graphs using GO.Implementation of add Vertex and add Edge using the adjacency list, and slice for the list using a basic data structure provided by Golang.                                     
|3 *|[Two Sum](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/two_sum) |Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
|4|[First Letter ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/firstLetter) |Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.
|5 *|[Maximum Subarray ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/maximum_subarray) |Given an integer array nums, find the subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum.
|6|[Move Zeroes ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/move_zeroes) |Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
|7|[Contains Duplicate ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/contains_duplicate) |Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
|8|[Rotate Array ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/rotate) |Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
|9 *|[Remove K From Linked List ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/remove-linked-list) |Given a singly linked list of integers l and an integer k, remove all elements from list l that have a value equal to k.
|10|[Rotate image ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/rotate_image) |You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
|11|[Find substrings ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/findSubstrings) |You have two arrays of strings, words and parts. Return an array that contains the strings from words, modified so that any occurrences of the substrings from parts are surrounded by square brackets [].
|12|[Sudoku grid validation ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/sudoku) |Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with numbers in such a way that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid all contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 one time.
|13|[Plus Minus ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/plusMinus) |Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.
|14|[Min Max sum  ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/minMax) |Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
|15 * |[Time Conversion ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/time_conversion) |Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time. Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
|16 *|[Binary Search tree ](https://github.com/Alessandrasdias/Golang_Sample_Projects/tree/main/bst) | Inserting data in a BST, searching a node in a BST and using Recursion.
