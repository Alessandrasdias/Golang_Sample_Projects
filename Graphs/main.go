// Graph represents and adjacency list graph
// Will needs a list that holds pointers of vertices in a slice

// bc it's an adjacency list, each vertex in the graph will have a list of vertices that is holding the vertex of the neighbors

// addVertex adds a vertex to the graph
// It's a method to the Graph, so, it's a pointer receiver, and it takes a key
// I will create a vertex inside the body that has k as the key, then it will be appended to the vertex list in the graph
// Test it here. Better safe, than sorry

// Contains
